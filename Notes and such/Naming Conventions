* Core-Kernel
This is the standard Mycroft for Android core app. It maintains the systems lifecycle, as well
the primary internal database

* Comm Center (Command Center)
THis is a central, user friendly portion of the application that allows for display, modification,
and use of the internal analytics and logic of the system. For instance, if Mycroft made a mistake
classifying an utterance, then a user can manually select the utterance, and change what it instead
should have referenced. This updated dataset will contribute to the future accuracy of the system, and
allow Mycroft to understand the users intents better.
