It is appearing that the Intent Parser (NNInentParser) is gaining some feature creep. Perhaps I will
have to split it off into two modules before too long.

The reason for this feature creep is that I am trying to keep the intent matching and parsing features
localized to a specific parser, so that the user can have multiple parsers installed. Unfortuately
this relies on a NN algorithm, which I have baked into the intent parser. As time goes on and
functionality changes I may move it into core instead and illustrate an API style call to the core.
We'll see, since I have to be sure it won't impact system battery life or significatly decreese app
speed
